# QPVutils

This package contains a series of helper functions to Query, Process (mainly text processing) and Visualize data (my default settings for ggplots) that I use on a daily basis. For now the getQuery function only allows to query data from Oracle via ROracle, but I intend to expand it to other DBs. Actually, the whole project is continuasly being improved, so feedback is always appreciated (cabralhenrique@zoho.com)
